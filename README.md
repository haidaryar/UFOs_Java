##Overview

UFO Sightings Finder website that will generate a list of recorded UFO sightings based on the 

search criteria. Search fields located on the right side of the page can help users find data on UFO sightings for their country, state, or city of interest. They can also narrow it down further by a specific date or UFO shape.

 

##Results

There are multiple fields users can narrow down their search in: Date, City, State, Country, Shape. Those interested to see data on previous UFO sightings can enter one of the aforementioned criteria into the provided search fields to find sightings that matches their data. Needless to say, they can also search based on all the given criteria. For instance, if someone is interested in listing of UFO sightings for California they can type ‘ca’ in the field labeled ‘Enter a State’. To narrow it down even further they can enter a city name into search field for cities. Results for their search will generate in a table on the right side of the search fields. Please note not to capitalize your search terms. The results for California will not generate if CA typed into the field. The ‘placeholder’ text inside each search field already showcases how it should be typed. Please see image below.

#\#Summary

This webpage works great overall. Results generate in a matter of seconds and the design is user friendly. However, there is one issue that can be deemed as a drawback: Search is case sensitive. If users type ‘US’ instead of ‘us’ nothing will populate. Generally, most people are used to capitalizing city and state names. I recommend we change the code to accommodate searching in both capital or small letters. Furthermore, I think giving the users the option of searching within a date range can be a welcome change to the website.
